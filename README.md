# Cloud Computing

#### Scope:
The repository will serve as what it is intended for, a repository of notes on cloud computing. Ideally, it will encompass as much as possible in the subject. I will go through several sources including classes, books, random notes and code that found on the internet (like that hasn't backfired before).

I will try to continually update this repository as much as I can, there is so much information out there and way too many cloud services. Will initially focus on Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, as they seem to be the most used.
